/*
It's Pong with a few twists. Let's call it "Spin Pong". There are surfaces that move
around the paddles and walls. These moving surfaces can be used to give the ball a spin
or undo existing spin. Pretty much like how you give a ball a spin in any ball-game; like
ping-pong, tennis or soccer.

Notes:
- this is merely a very early prototype to see if it would even be fun.
- it's fiendlishy hard in its current state. It needs to be simplified.

TODO power-ups:
- slow ball
- fast ball
- multiple balls
- larger bat
- smaller opponent bat
- freeze opponent wall
- freeze ball for N seconds (to adjust spin)
- reset ball spin and velocity (add some art in the middle of the field, and when ball hits, trigger effect)

TODO thoughts:
- perhaps reset surface speeds after each collision? will it make it harder or easier?
- round spin/speeds to integer between 0-10? show that number somewhere (next to wall/bats?) so you can easily counter?
- maybe hold key for spin, and releasing key resets it back to 0 spin
